 This project will analyze various types of “Tweets” (use Tweepy An easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API for collecting tweets) 
 during pandemic times. The study can be helpful for policy making by government and other organization.
 
For example, Government can make use of this information in policymaking as they can able to know how people are reacting to this new strain,
